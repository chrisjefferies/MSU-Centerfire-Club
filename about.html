			<h3>
				I am an international student. Specifically, a Nonimmigrant Alien on a 
				Student Visa. Can I still possess firearms as a non-citizen?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Good question. The reality is... it's complicated, and we're not lawyers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is something to read up on if you're interested in buying your own 
				firearms, legally. Basically, nonimmigrant aliens are on the same prohibition
				list as felons, and can only buy firearms if they meet certain waiver conditions,
				one of which seems to be possessing a valid hunting permit, and having lived 
				here for 90 days. 
				<a href="http://www.atf.gov/files/firearms/faq/non-immgrant-aliens-2.pdf">ATF 
				Nonimmigrant Alien FAQ</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you want to buy a firearm, great. You can join the club, and we can get
				you into hunter's safety courses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Michigan law, lawful aliens may also obtain a Concealed Pistol License, 
				if they've been a resident for six months.
			</p>
		</article>

			<h3>
				Okay, so that's how I buy firearms. How about if I just want to come out and 
				shoot them for a while?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Well, it looks like there's no legal difference between possession as owning
				one more or less permanently, and just holding or shooting one. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				18 U.S.C. §922(g):<br>
			    (g) It shall be unlawful for any person—<br>
			    ...<br>
    			(5) who, being an alien—<br>
   				...<br>
    			(B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(26)));<br>
    			... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.<br>
				<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">Full Statute</a>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				It seems to be that the statute prohibits possession by aliens, unless the firearm
				itself is outside the authority of the Federal Government under the Commerce Clause
				of the US Constitution (i.e. it has never crossed state lines, or affected commerce
				across state lines. Despite the original intent of the commerce clause, basically
				any firearm can be construed as falling under the authority of commerce clause today). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Until we get legal advice saying differently, our policy is that any MSU student
				who we know to be a nonimmigrant alien must be otherwise legally allowed to buy
				a firearm before we let them shoot one of ours.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Is this club a good place to participate in political advocacy on 2nd Amendment 
				issues or other issues?
			</h3>
			<p>
				No. In order to best support young shooters, this organization refrains from 
				political advocacy. The people you want to talk to are the <a href="http://www.nra.org" target="_blank">NRA</a>, <a href="http://www.nraila.org" target="_blank">NRA-ILA</a>,
				and <a href="http://www.friendsofnra.org/mi/" target="_blank">Friends of NRA, Michigan</a>. The MSU CENTERFIRE club supports preserving 
				2nd Amendment freedoms for future generations, and we feel we can best do this
				by teaching new shooters, and providing training and education to the student
				community.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="experience">
			<h3>
				Do I need any firearms experience to join?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Not at all! If joining this club seems like something you'd like to try, feel
				free to attend any one of our many events that are open to non-members, or
				ask about attending one of our members-only events for a small fee (usually 
				a range fee and the cost of ammo).
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="storage">
			<h3>
				Firearms, ammo and some accessories aren't allowed on campus. Where is equipment 
				stored?
			</h3>
			<p>
				All of our equipment is stored safely and securely off-campus at Looking Glass
				River Sportsman's Club. Club members can store their personal
				firearms and equipment with the club for free, or as per MSU policy, 
				with the MSU Police Department. In accordance with the law and University policy,
				all club affiliated firearms, ammo and accessories never come onto campus.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="recreational">
			<h3>
				I'd like to learn more about shooting, but I'm not really interested in any
				competitions. Is this still a good club for me? 
			</h3>
			<p>
				Absolutely! The MSU CENTERFIRE club has some great resources available for strictly
				recreational members, including (often free) equipment rental and discounts at
				area businesses and ranges. Club members also get the benefit of being in touch
				with others who share your interest, and can join in on-campus pizza and 
				billiards nights to meet new friends and talk guns. Recreationally-inclined 
				members are welcome attend casual clay pigeon, and steel plate pistol shoots, 
				which are a blast. Of course, practices geared toward competition are always
				open to all members, as well.

			<h3>
				So... MSU CENTERFIRE Club, MSU Rifle and Pistol Club... What's the deal?
			</h3>
			<p>
				We're the same entity. Since its inception as the Marksmanship Club, this shooting sports organization
				has been providing students an outlet for the safe use of firearms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The MSU Rifle and Pistol Club is a tax exempt organization dedicated to the shooting sports at
				Michigan State. 
			</p>
			<p>
				MSU CENTERFIRE is the recreational and action shooting division of the MSU Rifle and Pistol Club.
				We have always been a fluid entity, changing with the interests of its memebers. This club is simply 
				another iteration.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="demmer">
			<h3>
				Wait... Are you guys the same club as the <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~msussc" target="_blank">MSU Shooting Sports Club</a>?
			</h3>
			<p>
				No.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are a different club. We are a separate, non-affiliated entity as their facility does not support the needs 
				of our club.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are all happy to live on a campus that is so supporting of the shooting sports that there 
				are two clubs.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="safety">
			<h3>
				I see this club frequently uses black rifles, and guns with magazine capacities
				in excess of 30 rounds. Are these guns safe to use?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes.
			</p>
			<p>
				But let's be clear about one thing: the shooting sports, like any other sports, carry some
				inherent dangers, which is why we have extensive safety policies in place, and all
				new members are required to undergo range safety training before handling firearms.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="equipment">
			<h3>
				I'm sold. I want to shoot and compete. What equipment should I plan on buying?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Awesome. There are a lot of great products on the market, but making a good
				selection is based mostly on what you want to do. 
			</p>
			<p>
				ACTS is our most popular, best value event. Their monthly 2-gun matches challenge
				shooters to run, jump and crawl their way to engage a wide variety of targets
				with a combination of rifle and pistol shooting. Their are virtually no restrictions
				on what kind of guns to bring, but you should be looking for semi-automatic, magazine-fed
				weapons. Both AR-15 and AK-47 platform rifles are ideal. Full size handguns (with 15
				round capacity or more) work well for a sidearm, preferably in 9mm caliber, like the 
				Glock 17 or Springfield XD-9. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If TRAP is your game, you'll be looking for a 12ga shotgun, preferably with a 3" chamber.
				Almost any shotgun will work, but there are some shotguns that are optimized for
				trap competition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before you run to the store, make sure to check with the club. We often have 
				equipment in supply that you can use for practice and competition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to maximize your firearm dollars, and buy a gun that also functions well
				in hunting or home defense use, it may influence you buying choice as well. The
				MSU CENTERFIRE membership and coaching community is a great resource for some
				good info on the best products to meet your needs. Also, be sure to take advantage
				of the 10% discount on firearms offered to MSU CENTERFIRE shooters by 
				<a href="http://www.adcguns.com" target="_blank">Alpha Dog Customs</a>.
